Hi Sathish,
	Please work on the appointment card redesign. Its urgent/important than anything else. I am sending the current design (pdf). Please make the following changes.

1) The appointment section on the front should go to back side of the card (appointment, name,date,time and "if unable to keep..." text)
2) There's too many bullet points on the back of the card. we just need 4 or 6 (as below)
	Treating adults & children (6 months of age & above)
	Emergency Treatment
	Digital Xrays
	Root Canal, Extraction 
	Crowns,Bridges
	Nitrous Sedation
	Dental Implants
	Sports Guard
	Teeth Whitening
	Laser, Invisalign
	Same Day Crown
	Possible Same Day Appmt.

3) Insurances section and time section should move from back of the card to the front
4) The appointment section should come from the new white preview (file attached)
5) When creating  .ai file if you can't find the exact old font use a comparable good looking font to save time on research.

show previews to me as work progresses to save time. thanks
